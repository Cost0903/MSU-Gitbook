# Pioneers' Interview

From March 28 to 31, MapleStory Universe conducted an exclusive interview to gather live reviews and comments from the community on their experience during the MapleStory N Pioneer Test. Pioneers with the Novice and Rookie (now upgraded to Veteran)\* role in the official MapleStory Universe Discord channel were invited to take part in the interview session.

With an impressive overall rating of **4.89 out of 5.0**, the Pioneers described their MapleStory N gameplay experience as **revolutionary**. We've compiled a selection of their comments and hereby share it with the whole community.

We extend our heartfelt thanks once again to the members who have contributed so much to the growth of our community and took the time to share their thoughts through the interview. We hope your continued passion and support will inspire and help many new Maplers joining the adventure of MapleStory N.

**To all of our future Maplers:** discover the real voices of the Pioneers - and get ready to be one yourself.

MapleStory N officially launches on upcoming May 15. Stay excited and follow the journey on the [**Countdown Web!**](https://msu.io/maplestoryn/launch-countdown)
