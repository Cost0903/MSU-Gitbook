## 1. What are Set Items?

When you equip the required number of items from the same set, you can get various bonus effects.

Set items bonuses are additionally applied on top of the base stats of the equipped item. You can get set items just like other normal items â€“ by hunting bosses and field monsters, participating in events, and completing party quests.

## 2. Checking Set Effects

When you equip a set item, you can check the set effects and a list of all items needed to complete the set. The number of set items can be more than the maximum bonus requirements.

Note: You will not get additional effects even if you equip more set items than the number required for the maximum bonus.

## 3. Set Effect Application

If you equip items from multiple sets at the same time, each set effect Is applied altogether.

Additionally, if you equip the required number of pieces from the same set, all applicable bonuses will be applied.

**Example)** If you equip 3 items from the Boss Accessory Set and 6 items from the Royal Von Leon Magician Set, you will receive the following set bonuses:

*   Boss Accessory Set: **3-Set** Bonus
*   Royal Von Leon Magician Set **4-Set** Bonus
*   Royal Von Leon Magician Set **5-Set** Bonus
*   Royal Von Leon Magician Set **6-Set** Bonus
## 4. Lucky Items

Lucky items are the wildcards for set items!

If you have at least 3 items from the same set equipped, an additional Lucky item will count as one item from the exact set when equipped - granting you an even more powerful set bonus.
