*   You need to move items to your Wallet Inventory to make it searchable on Marketplace. To sell an item, please make sure it is in your Wallet Inventory, where all Marketplace purchases are automatically stored.
*   Be sure to move any purchased items into your Character Wallet to equip your character with them.

※ When an equipment item is moved from Wallet Inventory to Character Inventory, the item will be locked for 10 days (240 hours). While locked, the item cannot be moved back to the Wallet Inventory. You can check the remaining lock time in the item tooltip.

※ If a locked item is stored in NFT Collection, it can only be retrieved by the character who stored it. Once the lock period ends, the item can be retrieved by any character within the same account.

※ Only minted characters can store items in the Wallet Inventory. However, if you already have a minted character in your account or if a purchased item from Marketplace is stored in your Wallet Inventory, you can retrieve the item without minting a character.
