## 2. Item Quality
*   The quality of an in-game item is determined by the sum of its stats.
*   The item quality is divided into 7 levels, and you can distinguish the level of the item with colors.
*   The item quality is not an absolute standard for evaluating equipment, but rather a reference. It is recommended that you select equipment based on each Job's main stat or whether the equipment has your preferred stats.
