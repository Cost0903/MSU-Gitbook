## 1. Items in MapleStory N

While playing MapleStory N, you can obtain and use various types of items such as Equipment, Consumables, and Decoration items.

However, depending on the status of each item, there may be differences in whether it can be minted or how it can be used.

For a more enjoyable gameplay experience, be sure to check the specific characteristics of each item!

## 2. How to Distinguish Items

In MapleStory N, items are broadly categorized into Mintable, NFT, FT, Local and SBT items.

| Mintable Items |  |
| NFT Items |  |
| FT Itmes |  |
| Local Items |  |
| SBT Items |  |

### 2.1. Mintable Items
*   **Mintable items** can be identified by the **cloud-shaped icon** at the bottom-right corner of the item image.
*   **Equipment items** can be equipped but cannot be enhanced or traded before minting.
*   **Decoration items** can be worn but cannot be traded before minting.
*   **Consumable items** can be used but cannot be traded before minting.
### 2.2. NFT Items
*   NFT items are **non-consumable items** that have been successfully minted.
*   Once minted, the item **no longer displays the cloud-shaped icon.**
### 2.3. FT Items
*   FT items are **consumable items** that have been successfully minted.
*   As NFT items, FT items **do not display the cloud-shaped icon** once minted.
*   When an FT item is minted, it is automatically moved to the Wallet Inventory.
    *   To use an FT item, you must transfer it from the Wallet Inventory to the Character Inventory.

### 2.4. Local Items
*   Local items can be identified by the **“L” icon** at the bottom-right of the item image.
*   They can only be used within MapleStory N and **cannot be traded or enhanced.**
### 2.5. SBT Items
*   SBT items are **wallet-bound items** that cannot be traded.
*   If your wallet holds SBT items of MapleStory Universe, they can also be used in MapleStory N.
*   After opening the Wallet Inventory, you can transfer and copy SBT items to the Character Inventory, in which they will appear as **Local items**.
*   Once copied to the Character Inventory, the same item cannot be copied again.
    *   If the character is **unlinked**, the copied SBT item will be **deleted**. You cannot transfer SBT items via character trading.
