## 1. What is a Pet?

Pets are loyal companions that accompany you throughout your adventures in MapleStory N. They offer convenient support, such as **automatically picking up dropped NESO and items** during field monster hunting. You can also make pets use certain buff skills on your behalf.

Each character can equip up to 3 pets, and pets are categorized into Normal Pets and Multi Pets.

*   **Normal Pets** cannot be equiped with other normal pets.
*   **Multi Pets** can be equipped with up to two other normal or multi pets.
## 2. Pet Level

You can increase your Closeness with your pets by using pet commands and playing with it. As Closeness builds up, the pet level increases.

*   The higher the pet level, the more commands become available for use.
## 3. Pet Skill

Each pet comes with its own unique base skills, depending on its type.

You can check which skills your pet has by hovering your mouse over the pet.

Pets may possess a variety of helpful skills, including:

|  | Auto Buff | When a skill is registered as an auto buff, the pet will automatically cast it. |
|  | Pet Training | Trains the pet to better collect items and NESO on multi-level fields. |
|  | Auto HP Potion | Automatically uses a registered HP potion when HP falls below the warning threshold. |
|  | Auto MP Potion | Automatically uses a registered MP potion when MP falls below the warning threshold. |
|  | Auto Pickup | Automatically picks up items and NESO within range, even when the character is not moving. |
|  | NESO Pickup | Adds the ability to pick up NESO to pets that can only pick up items. |
|  | Item Pickup | Adds the ability to pick up items to pets that can only pick up NESO. |
|  | Expanded Movement | Expands the pet movement range by 3x. |
|  | Pet Giant Skill | As you hunt level-range monsters, the pet gradually grows in size. When it reaches a certain size, it casts a mystical buff. |
|  | Magnet Effect | The pet automatically pulls in items and NESO within its magnetic field range. |

| The threshold for auto HP/MP potion usage can be configured via [Setting] > [Option] > [Notification Setting] or through [Equipment Window] > [Pet] > [Potion Use].To set a Pet Buff Skill, open your Skill Window, then drag a desired buff skill into the Pet Equipment window at the bottom to enable automatic casting. |
