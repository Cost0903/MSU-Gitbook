## 1. What is NFT Collection?

NFT Collection is a system that enables you to register minted in-game items you own. You can get special NFT Collection effects based on your NFT Collection Score and set combination.

Only minted characters can register items in NFT Collection, and the NFT Collection effects will be applied to all characters in the account.

※ For detail information, please refer to \[[Manage Character Guide](https://docs.maplestoryn.io/msn-101/beginners-guide/get-started/manage-character)\].

## 2. How to Add Items to NFT Collection

Click \[NFT Collection\] in the N-shaped \[NFT ASSETS\] menu at the bottom of the game to open your NFT Collection.

※ Items already registered in your NFT Collection cannot be registered again.

※ Items stored in the Wallet Inventory cannot be registered to your NFT Collection. If you want to register the items to your NFT Collection, move them to your Character Inventory.

※ Depending on the type of the selected item, it will be registered as either Normal Equipment or Set Equipment.

※ For Set Equipment, you can get additional set effects by registering the entire equipment set.

2) To register multiple in-game items to your NFT Collection at once, click the “**Bulk Register**” button at the top right corner of the NFT Collection window to check the list of minted items and register them.
