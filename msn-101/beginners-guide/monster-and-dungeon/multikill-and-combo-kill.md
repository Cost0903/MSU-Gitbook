## 1. What is Multikill?

A Multikill occurs when you defeat 3 or more monsters at once.

The number of your multikills appears at the top of the screen, and you gain bonus EXP based on how many multikills you have.

*   Your Multikill number can increase up to a maximum of 10.

## 2. What is Combo Kill?

A Combo Kill occurs when you kill monsters continuously without long pauses.

Every time you reach 50 Combo Kills, a Combo Kill Orb will be generated, which grants bonus EXP.

You can accumulate up to 9,999 Combo Kills. When a Combo Kill Orb is created, your character gains EXP based on the current combo count and gains a temporary speed boost.

*   Combo Kill Orbs can upgrade up to Level 4 depending on your accumulated combos, and each level provides greater EXP.

#### Combo Kill Orb bonus EXP based on Combo Count

| 350-700 Combos | Normal monster base EXP 700% |
| 750-1950 Combos | Normal monster base EXP 1,000% |

*   Combo count increases based on the number of skills used to defeat monsters, not the number of monsters killed.
*   Combo Kill count persists for a certain amount of time even if you change maps. During Bounty Hunter or Inferno Wolf, combos remain for up to 20 seconds after exiting.
*   Your Combo Kill Orbs are visible only to you, and you must touch them within 1 minute to gain EXP.
