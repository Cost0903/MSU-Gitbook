*   They disappear if not entered within approximately 90 seconds.
*   Only field monsters within 20 levels of your character have a chance to trigger a Random Portal.
## 2. Inferno Wolf Portal

You can attack the Inferno Wolf for up to 20 seconds after entering the map.

*   Other players can also join the battle.
*   All players in the world must attack the Inferno Wolf within 20 second window to reduce its HP. In-game rewards are only granted if the Inferno Wolf is successfully defeated.

The amount of EXP and rewards you earn will depend how much damage you deal. Once the Inferno Wolf is defeated, you can review your participation at \[Raffle Dashboard\] > \[Raffle Entry\]. After the raffle, rewards can be claimed at \[Raffle Dashboard\] > \[Raffle Results\].

## 3. Bounty Hunter Portal

The first Bounty Hunter Portal of the day will randomly lead you to one of three Pollo events or four Fritto events.

*   If your previous entry was a Pollo event, the next Portal will lead to a random Fritto event.
