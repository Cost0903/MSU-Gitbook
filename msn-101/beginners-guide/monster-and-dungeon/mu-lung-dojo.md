![](images/msn-101/beginners-guide/monster-and-dungeon/image_1747236330034_644.png)

*   You can start the Mu Lung Dojo challenge by speaking with NPC So Gong.
*   Once the challenge begins, you will be moved to the Mu Lung Dojo Entrance, where all active buff effects are removed by So Gong’s special martial arts technique.
*   At the entrance, you will have 2 minutes to prepare. When ready, enter the portal on the right to begin.
*   If you do not enter within 2 minutes, the challenge will automatically start and the Mu Lung Dojo time limit will begin.
## 5. Effects in Mu Lung Dojo
*   Inside the dojo, Mu Gong’s barrier limits you to only one-tenth of your normal strength.
*   Additionally, the use of potion items is partially restricted within the dojo.

*   After clearing a floor, you will receive 10 seconds of recovery time.
*   This is a change to apply buffs or prepare for the next battle.
*   Note: These 10 seconds do not count toward the overall 15-minute limit.

*   If you wish to give up the challenge, you can forfeit by speaking to NPC So Gong, located at the top of the screen.
*   Even if you forfeit, the highest floor reached will still be recorded in the rankings.

**Caution!**

*   Your ranking will only reflect the last floor you cleared and exited through the portal.
*   If you defeat the monsters but do not enter the next portal, your progress will not be recorded in the rankings.
## 7. Mu Lung Dojo Records
*   If you achieve your weekly best record in a challenge, it will be registered in the rankings.
*   Your play record is based on the highest floor you cleared and the total time it took. The higher the floor you clear, the higher your ranking.
*   If multiple players clear the same floor, the one who does so in the shortest time will be ranked higher.
*   If both the cleared floor and time are identical, the player who registered their record earlier will be placed higher in the rankings.
