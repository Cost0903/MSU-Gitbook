## 1. What is Maple Achievement?

Maple Achievement is a world-integrated system that records your gameplay accomplishments in MapleStory N. Characters of which Level 33 or higher can check their achievement status after completing the Begin Maple Achievements quest from the Quest Notifier. This quest can only be completed once per account. Once completed, you can check your achievement information from the menu at the bottom right of the screen.

*   Achievement information is shared across all characters on your account.
*   If you purchase a character from the Marketplace, progress or records made before the purchase will not count toward your achievement.
    *   However, achievements can be completed using the purchased character if progress is made after acquisition.
