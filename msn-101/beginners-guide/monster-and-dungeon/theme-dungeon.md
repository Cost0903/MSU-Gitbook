## 3. Theme Dungeon Features
### 3.1. Theme Dungeons are solo-only hunting grounds.

In these dungeon fields, monsters are summoned individually for each player. Since monsters are not shared with others, quests can be completed more quickly than in other areas.

### 3.2. Monster levels scale with your character.

Monsters in the Theme Dungeon start at Level 30, but if your character is higher level, appropriately leveled monsters will be summoned.

However, for characters above Level 60, monster levels will not exceed Level 59.

### 3.3 Quest completion EXP scales with character level.

Even when completing the same quest, the amount of EXP gained will vary depending on your character's level, allowing for faster progression.
