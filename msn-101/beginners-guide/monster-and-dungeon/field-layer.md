## 1. What is a Field Layer?

In MapleStory N, field rewards are distributed based on a specific system called layers.

Field Layers are divided according to the average monster level and can be checked through the World Map or Reward Dashboard. You can open the Reward Dashboard by clicking the star-shaped Reward menu at the bottom of the screen and selecting the Reward Dashboard tab.

| Since rewards are limited and replenish periodically, your chances of receiving rewards are higher when you hunt in layers with more rewards accumulated. |

## 2. Checking Layer Information via the World Map

When you select a specific field, you can view:

*   The layer number it belongs to
*   The reward information available in that layer

Each field on the World Map is color-coded, with each color representing a different layer.
