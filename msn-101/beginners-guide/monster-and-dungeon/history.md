## 1. What is History?

The History system allows you to record and review specific events or moments that your character has completed using minted items.

※ Only minted characters can use History.

For more information on minting characters and items, please refer to the \[[Manage Character Guide](/msn-101/beginners-guide/get-started/manage-character)\] and \[[Items Guide](/msn-101/beginners-guide/item-and-equipment/items)\].

There are two types of History:

### 1.1 History Mission

Tracks specific events or milestones that your character can experience. You can manage their achievement progress here.

### 1.2 Item History

Allows you to view and manage the History of each minted item, including selecting a Representative History.

## 2. History Mission

History Missions are available to characters with minted items, and they can be completed on a per-character basis.

To access, open the N-shaped \[NFT ASSETS\] menu and select \[History Mission\].
