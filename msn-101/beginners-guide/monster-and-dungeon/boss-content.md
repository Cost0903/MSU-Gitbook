Once you select a boss and its difficulty level, you can search for party members to fight with you. Alternatively, open the Maple Guide with the shortcut key \[Default: F1\] and click the Boss Content tab. Here, you can find recommended bosses by level range, as well as a list of reward items each boss drops.
