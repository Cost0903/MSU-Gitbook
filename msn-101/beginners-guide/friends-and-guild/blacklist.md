## 1. What is a Blacklist?

You can add blacklist users you do not want to see again or block from chatting while playing the game.

If you add a character to the blacklist, its entire account will be blacklisted.

## 2. Managing Blacklist

You cannot register the same character or account to both your friends list and blacklist.

*   In the case of account friends, characters within the same world cannot be registered in the blacklist at the same time.
*   In the case of a blacklist, you cannot register other characters in the same world as account friends or friends.

Additionally, the guild you are currently in cannot be added to the guild blacklist.
