## 1. What is Star Force Enhancement?

Star Force is a system that allows you to further enhance your minted equipment items and upgrading their stats.

Each item can be enhanced up to the number of empty stars (☆) shown at the top of the item tooltip. When an enhancement succeeds, a star is filled in as a ★, and the Star Force level of the item increases by +1, boosting its stats.

If enhancement fails, the Star Force level may either stay the same or decrease by -1. When the level decreases, the item stats will decrease accordingly.

## 2. Equipment Enhancement: Star Force Enhancement

You can access Enhancement UI by clicking \[Equipment Enhancement\] in the \[NFT ASSETS\] at the bottom of the game screen, or by clicking the “ENHANCE” button in your Character Inventory.

You can perform Star Force Enhancement, Potential Enhancement, and Bonus Stats Enhancement at the Enhancement UI.

Within the Star Force Enhancement UI, you can check the following information:

1.  **Type of enhancement you selected**
2.  **Item you selected for enhancement** — be sure to double-check that the correct item is selected before proceeding.
3.  **Current Star Force level of the selected item**
4.  **Chance of Success** details for the current Star Force level
5.  Options to check **Star Catch** and **Major Failure Prevention**
6.  Information on stat obtained upon successful enhancement
7.  **Number of Owned Power Crystals** and the **Required Power Crytals** for the selected item — note that this cost updates every minute.
## 3. Performing Star Force Enhancement

When you start Enhancement, you can choose the desired enhancement type, and select the item you would like to enhance.

Star Force Enhancement consumes **Power Crystals**, and the number of crystals required varies depending on the current Star Force level of the equipment item. Additionally, the cost for each stage is **updated every minute** based on enhancement demand.

Before enhancing, make sure to check both the Power Crystals you own and required for the enhancement displayed at the bottom of the UI.

If you do not have enough Power Crystals, click the “**Exchange**” button next to **Owned Power Crystals** to convert your NESO into Power Crystals at a **1:1 ratio.**

※ NESOLET cannot exchanged into Power Crystals. You must first mint your NESOLET into NESO to exchange for Power Crystals.

※ For instructions on how to mint NESO, please refer to the \[[**NEXO & NXPC Guide**](/msn-101/learn-more/neso-and-nxpc)\].

Once everything is ready, click the “Enhance” button to begin the enhancement.

When the enhancement starts, Star Catch will begin. If you successfully complete Star Catch, your chance of enhancement success will increase.

Stop the horizontally moving star when it enters the yellow zone to get Star Catch benefit. If you prefer not to use Star Catch, you can check “Disable Star Catching” in the Enhancement UI before starting.

※ If Disable Star Catching is on, you will not receive the bonus success rate granted by successful Star Catching.

When enhancement is completed, it may succeed or fail based on the pre-announced probability.

During Star Force Enhancement, there is a chance of a **Major Failure**, starting from 12 Stars and above. In the event of a Major Failure, the Star Force level will drop to 10.

*   Between 12 to 17 Star Force level, you can check the Major Failure Prevention checkbox to prevent this from occurring.
*   Enabling Major Failure Prevention will increase enhancement cost.
## 4. Star Force Enhancement Cost

The cost of Star Force Enhancement is determined by unique mechanics of MapleStory N, which is called Dynamic Pricing system. The more demand on enhancement for a specific item group among players occurs, the higher the enhancement cost. The lower the demand for enhancement, the lower the enhancement cost.

You can check the current enhancement cost of the selected equipment in the Required Power Crystals section at the bottom, and you can check the enhancement cost information of the equipment by clicking the “Cost Info” button on the right side of the section.

The enhancement cost refreshes every minute, and you can check the remaining time until the refreshment in the Required Power Crystals section.

Information on Star Force Enhancement costs can be found not only in-game, but also on the MapleStory N official website at \[Game Status\] > \[[Dynamic Pricing](https://dynamic%20pricing/)\] section.
