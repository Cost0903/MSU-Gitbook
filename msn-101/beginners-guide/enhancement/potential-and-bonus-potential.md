## 1. What is Potential & Bonus Potential?

**Potential and Bonus Potentia**l is a system that allows you to grant or reset potential abilities on your **minted equipment items** to upgrade their stats.

All items drop w**ithout potential by default.** After granting Potential or Bonus Potential for the first time, you can reset them to try for the stats you want.

*   You **can only grant Potential** for the first time using **Occult Cube.**
*   You **can only grant Bonus Potential** for the first time using **Bonus Occult Cube.**
## 2. Potential Ranks

Potential and Bonus Potential are divided into four ranks.

When using a cube, 3 lines of randomized Potential will be generated based on the item’s current Potential Rank. The color and stats of these lines vary by rank.

For Bonus Potential, the rank colors are the same, but the stats given may be lower.

## 3. Cube Types

There are several types of Cubes used to grant and reset Potential.

Each cube type has its own rank ranges for which they can be used, and the usage cost also differs.

Please refer to the table below for the highest possible rank and use effects of each cube.

### 3.1. Potential

| Occult Cube | Epic | Existing stats are replaced with 3 new lines of stats. |

## 4. Equipment Enhancement: Potential UI

You can perform S**tar Force Enhancement, Potential Enhancement, and Bonus Stats Enhancement** through the **Equipment Enhancement UI.**

In the **Potential Enhancement** tab, you can check the following:

1.  **The type of enhancement selected**
2.  **The item selected for enhancement** — be sure to double-check that the correct item is selected before proceeding.
3.  **The type of Cube selected** and the **highest rank** it can achieve — make sure the desired Cube is selected before enhancing.
4.  **Current Potential** lines on the left under **Current Enhancement Info** — if the item has no Potential, this section will be blank. Once Potential is granted or reset, the **Enhancement Result** will be shown on the right.
5.  **The number of Power Crystals** you own and the **current enhancement cost** for the selected item — Enhancement costs are dynamically adjusted every minute.
## 5. Enhancing Potential

After opening the Enhancement UI, select the type of enhancement you want and choose the item to enhance.

Potential enhancement consumes **Power Crystals**, and the amount required is determined by:

*   Equipment Type
*   Selected Cube
*   Current demand for enhancement based on the item’s Potential rank

The cost is **updated every minute.**

Before proceeding, make sure to double-check the amount of Power Crystals you own and the current enhancement cost at the bottom of the Enhancement UI.

If you do not have enough **Power Crystals**, click the Exchange button next to Owned Power Crystals to convert your NESO into Power Crystals at a 1:1 ratio.

※ NESOLET cannot be used to exchange for Power Crystals. If you only have NESOLET, you must mint it into NESO first.

※ For instructions, please refer to the [\[**NESO & NXPC Guide\]**](https://docs.maplestoryn.io/msn-101/learn-more/neso-and-nxpc).

Once everything is ready, click the “**Enhance**” button to begin the enhancement.

*   In the case of Potential Enhancement, clicking Enhance will immediately grant or reset the item's Potential.
*   If you're using a **Black Cube**, you will be able to choose between the current and newly generated Potential stats after enhancement.

## 6. Potential Enhancement Cost

The cost of enhancing Potential is dynamically adjusted based on overall demand.

*   The higher the desire for Potential enhancement for a specific item group among Maplers, the higher the change cost. The lower the desire for enhancement, the lower the change cost.
*   You can check the current Potential enhancement cost of the selected equipment in the Required Power Crystals section at the bottom, and you can check the Potential enhancement cost information of the equipment by clicking the button on the right side.
*   The cost to enhance Potential refreshes every minute, and you can check the remaining time until the cost refreshes in the "Power Crystals Required" section.
*   Information on Potential enhancement costs can be found not only in-game, but also on the MapleStory N official website under the [Dynamic Pricing](https://msu.io/maplestoryn/gamestatus/dynamicpricing) section.
*   To learn more about Dynamic Pricing, please refer to the \[[**Dynamic Pricing Guide**](/msn-101/learn-more/dynamic-pricing)\].
