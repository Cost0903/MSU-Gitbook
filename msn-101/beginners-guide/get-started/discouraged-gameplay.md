MapleStory N monitors abnormal gameplay behavior in accordance with its operation policies. Beyond the use of explicit hacks or macros, certain behaviors are strongly discouraged.

Below is a detailed guide on what constitutes discouraged gameplay and how such behavior is monitored.

## 1. Discouraged Gameplay

MapleStory N is intended to be played as a standalone client. Running abnormal programs alongside MapleStory N or tampering with PC or network data may prevent proper gameplay logging and is treated as an attempt to bypass detection.

If you engage in the following behaviors, it may be considered use of unauthorized programs, so we strongly advise against them:

1.  Playing on a wallet account that belongs to someone else
2.  Accessing or playing via remote control programs
3.  Running multiple clients simultaneously (including those launched via OS-level features)
4.  Using software/devices to monitor and control multiple PCs or wallets simultaneously
5.  Accessing or playing using spoofing tools (e.g., IP/MAC address spoofing, virtual hardware)
6.  Using hardware/software that enables macro or repeated input functions (e.g., special keyboards, mouses, joysticks, controllers)
*   Use of such devices is not restricted by the system, but abnormal patterns may still result in enforcement
1.  Launching or playing the game alongside unofficial/unsupported programs
2.  Running illegal programs used in other games while playing MapleStory N
3.  Repeatedly failing the in-game security systems (e.g., Lie Detector)
4.  Farming in-game currency or items using multiple wallets on the same IP/device for personal gain
*   Accounts using system information flagged for abnormal activity may be treated as belonging to the same user
1.  Any other repetitive gameplay pattern that significantly deviates from normal play behavior

※ Running non-game related apps (e.g., music/video players) will not be flagged as abnormal programs.

※ Any software used to open or modify the MapleStory N client or resources is subject to restriction regardless of actual usage.

※ If new forms of unsupported behavior are identified, this document will be updated continuously.

## 2. Monitoring Criteria and Methods

If unauthorized programs or abnormal patterns are detected, game restrictions may be applied based on the following criteria:

*   Repeated use of unsupported gameplay practices
*   Activity patterns that significantly deviate from those of most Maplers

※ Monitoring includes not only recent activity but also up to 90 days of past gameplay records. Thus, the date of restriction may not align with the date of violation.

※ If multiple policy violations are detected, the most severe violation will determine the penalty.

## 3. Verification Request for Game Restrictions

If your account is restricted, you may request for verification to clarify or re-investigate by contacting our [Support](https://support.msu.io/hc/en-us) within 90 days from the start of the restriction.

To help us verify your case more quickly and accurately, please include the following information:

1.  If you used an unsupported gameplay, describe in detail:
*   What program was used
*   When it was used
*   Any unusual circumstances during gameplay
1.  Even if your actions do not exactly match the listed violations,
*   Please list any program run alongside MapleStory N or special gameplay conditions.
1.  If you played for an extended period while repeating the same input,
*   Please describe your skill rotation and repetitive key inputs during gameplay.
