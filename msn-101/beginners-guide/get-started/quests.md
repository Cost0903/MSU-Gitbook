## 1. Receiving Quests from NPCs

An NPC in need of help will have a flashing lightbulb above their head.

Click on the NPC with the flashing lightbulb, or press \[SPACE\] key near the NPC to ask them about their concerns.

## 2. Receiving Quests via Notifier

The Notifier section on the left side of the game screen is a convenient way for your character to start major quests!

Instead of talking to an NPC, you can accept quests through the lightbulb shaped Available Quests icons in the Notifier section.

You can also accept event quests and get information about ongoing events through the star-shaped Available Events icon.

Quests that you can accept from Available Quests/Events icon would provide you richer gameplay experience and help your adventure in MapleStory N.

Quests you get automatically through the Available Quests are mostly mandatory. It is strongly recommended that you accept and complete them.

Press shortcut key \[Default: Q\] to review information about quests you have accepted through the Available Quest or by visiting NPCs directly.
