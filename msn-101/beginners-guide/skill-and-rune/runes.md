## 1. Using Runes

Runes will spawn regularly in fields where players are hunting, and a message will appear in the center of it to notify players when they spawn. When your character is near a rune, tap the \[SPACE\] Bar (Pickup shortcut key) on your keyboard to use it.

If you do not tap the arrow keys in the correct order within 10 seconds, you will have to wait a penalty time of about 3 seconds before you can try again.

Use a rune to get EXP +100% for 180 seconds. You will also get various additional effects depending on the type of rune you use. Check the upper right side of the screen to see which rune effects you have. You can see a list of all of the effects by mousing over the buff icon. Right click the buff icon to remove specific rune effects.

*   The rune's buff only applies to the character who released the rune. It does not apply to party members.
*   If your character's level is 10 or more levels lower than the monsters in the current field, you cannot use the rune in that field.
*   Runes do not generate in some fields.
*   Only one person can activate a rune at a time.
## 2. Rune Curse

If a rune is left unused for too long, it will trigger a curse.

When a rune curse is triggered in the field, it will decrease the player's EXP obtained and item drop rate.

A rune curse has four stages.

*   **Stage 1 Curse Effect**: EXP obtained reduced by 50%, item and NESO drop rate reduced by 50%
*   **Stage 2 Curse Effect**: EXP obtained reduced by 65%, item and NESO drop rate reduced by 65%
*   **Stage 3 Curse Effect**: EXP obtained reduced by 80%, item and NESO drop rate reduced by 80%
*   **Stage 4 Curse Effect**: EXP obtained reduced by 100%, item and NESO drop rate reduced by 100%

To lift the rune curse, you must use a rune.

Once you use a rune, your EXP obtained and drop rates will return to their normal values.

*   While you are receiving a rune's effects, you will not be affected by the rune curse.
