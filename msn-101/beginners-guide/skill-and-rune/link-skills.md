## 1. What Are Link Skills?

Every Job has a unique Link Skill, which can be shared with other characters in the same world to grant them powerful Stats.

The effects of Link Skills applies to the character who owns it. When a character reaches Level 70, their Link Skill becomes available for transfer to another character in the same world.
