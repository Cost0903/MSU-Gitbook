## 1. What is Honor EXP?

Honor EXP is a type of point that can be earned by hunting normal monsters, elite monsters, and boss monsters.

## 3. What are Abilities?

Your character has special hidden abilities.

Once you reach Lv. 50, you can unlock these abilities by completing the quest 'The Eye Opener' via the Star Event notifier. After completing the quest, you can check your character's abilities by pressing the “Details” button in the Character Stats window (shortcut key \[Default: S\]).

The stats and values of abilities vary depending on the level of the ability, and they can be reset.

### 3.1. Resetting Abilities

Abilities can be reset by using 100 points of Honor EXP. Stats that you do not wish to reset can be locked so that only unlocked stats will be reset. However, you must also lock the rank to lock the stats, and locking ranks and stats increases the Honor EXP required for the reset.

Ranks can be locked starting from Unique.

*   All items in the Honor EXP Shop are Local items.
