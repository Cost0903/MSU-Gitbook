## 1. What is AP?

AP stands for Ability Points. You can use AP to increase your character’s basic stats: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Luck (LUK), as well as maximum HP and MP. To check your character’s stats, press the shortcut key \[Default: S\].

You can increase STR, DEX, INT, or LUK by 1 point using AP. The amount of AP required to increase HP and MP depends on your character's Job.

### 1.1. Stat Distribution
*   **Gaining AP**: You receive 5 AP each time you level up, with additional AP granted upon certain Job advancement.
*   **Using AP**: You can accumulate AP to HP, MP, STR, DEX, INT, or LUK. If you are unsure where to allocate points, you can use the "AUTO-ASSIGN" button to distribute AP based on your Job’s recommended stats.

You can then assign the points to different stats as desired.

## 2. What is SP?

SP stands for Skill Points, which are used to level up and enhance your Skills. Press the shortcut key \[Default: K\] to open the Skill window and view your current Skills. Each Skill has a maximum level, and each point of SP increases a Skill's level by 1.

*   **Gaining SP**: From Level 1 to 100, you get 3 SP per level. Starting at Level 101, you get 3 SP for most levels, and 6 SP for levels ending in 0, 3, 6, or 9. (Example: Level 101 = 3 SP, Level 103 = 6 SP) Certain Job advancements grant additional SP.

## 3. What are Hyper Skills?

Hyper Skills are powerful abilities that you can learn starting at Level 140. They include passive skill enhancements, powerful attacks, and active buff skills.

*   **Passive Skill Enhancements:** These skills boost the effects of your existing skills in various ways. New passive Hyper Skills unlock at specific level milestones. You will earn Hyper Skill SP at Level 140, 150, 165, 180, and 190.
