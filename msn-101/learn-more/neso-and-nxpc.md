## 1. What is NESO?

**NESO** is an **on-chain currency** used within **MapleStory Universe**. It is used to **enhance items** in **MapleStory N** and to conduct **transactions** on the **Marketplace**.

You can obtain NESO by **minting NESOLET**, and the two currencies have distinct icons, as shown below:

|  | NESOLET | NESOLET can be obtained by playing in-game contents. |
|  | NESO | NESO can be obtained by minting NESOLET or swapping NXPC. |

### 1.1. Earning NESO Through Gameplay

You can obtain NESO by minting NESOLET, which is earned through various in-game activities such as hunting monsters and clearing boss content.

*   NESOLET in its unminted state cannot be used for item enhancement or trading, so be sure to mint any NESOLET you acquire!
*   The total amount of NESOLET and NESO you have accumulated is displayed at the bottom of your character’s inventory.
*   You can view detailed values via the tooltip and use the NESO button at the bottom of the inventory to mint your NESOLET into NESO.
    *   The conversion rate from NESOLET to NESO is 1:1.

※ NESOLET is a character-bound currency and cannot be used by other characters in your wallet until it is minted.

※ Only the character that completed the minting process can mint NESOLET into NESO. For more details, please refer to the \[[Manage Character Guide](https://docs.maplestoryn.io/msn-101/beginners-guide/get-started/manage-character)\].

### 1.2. Earning NESO via SWAP & WARP

If you have NXPC in your wallet, you can swap it for NESO using the **SWAP & WARP** feature.

Once the swap is complete, the converted NESO can be used on the MSU Marketplace, and if you play the game using the same wallet, it can also be used in-game.
