## 1. What is Dynamic Pricing?

![](images/msn-101/learn-more/image_1747236425322_997.png)

Real-world economic principles apply to item upgrades, with prices fluctuating based on real-time demand and updating every 60 seconds for efficient price discovery.

When many Maplers seek to upgrade a particular item, its upgrade price increases automatically. Less popular items remain more affordable.

This provides strategic gameplay as players can either pursue meta items at higher prices or find value in underutilized items.

Prices are calculated using a specific pricing formula based on demand, and all pricing changes are transparently displayed on the MapleStory N website via the **Dynamic Pricing Dashboard**.

※ The same dynamic pricing system applies to all worlds in MapleStory N.

## 2. Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

The Dynamic Pricing main page provides the following information, allowing Maplers to easily view all key data related to dynamic pricing at a glance:

### 2.1. Total Item Enhancement Data

![](images/msn-101/learn-more/image_1747236425322_166.png)

1.  **Total Enhancement Count:** Displays the total number of item enhancements completed in a day / 30 days.
2.  **Total Enhancement Cost:** Displays the total price of item enhancements completed in a day / 30 days.

※ The previous day’s data is updated daily at 4:00 AM (UTC +0), and there may be differences from the latest data.

### 2.2. Enhancement Counts by Item Group

This section displays the number of enhancement attempts and percentage changes by item group over 1 day and 7 days.

An item group consists of the following aspects, ensuring all grouped items share the same enhancement attributes:

*   Equipment level
*   Equipment parts
*   Equipment types

The main purpose is to consolidate fragmented demand across many individual items into a meaningful scale of demand.

Detailed price information for a specific item can be checked in either of the following ways:

1.  Select an item group
2.  Search for an item using the “Search” bar

※ The previous day’s data is updated daily at 4:00 AM (UTC +0), and may differ from real-time data.

You can apply filters in the “Enhancement Counts by Item Group” section to narrow the displayed dynamic pricing data:

*   **Enhancement Type:** Choose between “Star Force” and “Potential”.
*   **Equipment Level:** Set a range between level 0 and 250.
*   **Equipment Parts:** Select one or more equipment parts you want to analyze.
*   **Equipment Type:** Select one or more item sets (or “Normal” if not a set) you want to analyze.

After applying filters, you can view the following information:

*   **Item Group:** Information of an item, such as item level range, item set, and item part.
*   **1D Enhance:** Number of enhancements completed on the previous day
*   **1D Change:** Day-over-day change in enhancement count (percentage)
*   **7D Enhance:** Totalenhancements completed over the past 7 days.
*   **7D Change:** Change in the number of enhancements over the past 7 –days compared to the 7 days before that.
