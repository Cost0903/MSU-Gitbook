## 1. What is Raffle?

When clearing boss content or special content in MapleStory N, you may have a chance to participate in a raffle based on probability.

A raffle is held among Maplers who successfully entered, and rewards are distributed based on the raffle results.

Challenge various bosses and special contents, and seize the thrilling opportunity to win in the raffle!

## 2. What is Raffle Dashboard?

Raffle Dashboard is a page where you can check reward details obtained after clearing boss or special content.

The Raffle Dashboard is divided into two tabs: “Raffle Entry” and “Raffle Results.” In both tabs, you can view the following information:

*   Name and image of the cleared content
*   Content difficulty (for Boss content)
*   Clear Information
*   Reward List
    *   When you hover over an item in the reward list, a tooltip will appear showing detailed reward distribution information.
