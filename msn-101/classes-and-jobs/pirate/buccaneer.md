#### Master of fighting who blows enemies away with a Sea Serpent

Buccaneer is a master of martial arts using bare knuckles while wielding the power of a Sea Serpent. Buccaneer's fighting skills resonate with the fury of the ocean, and the Serpent appears to further enhance attacks. When the Serpent has appeared a certain number of times, a powerful Serpent Assault skill is activated, resulting in an ultimate strike that blows all enemies out of the water.
