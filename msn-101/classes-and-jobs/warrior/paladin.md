#### A crusader wearing heavy armor who uses holy power

Paladin is a heavily-armed warrior with the power of holy light. Paladin's holy power resides in their heavy armor, which allows them to withstand the enemy's attacks while also providing strong support to their allies. The hammer Paladin uses leaves a stigma that sweeps away the surroundings, or brands the targeted enemy for even greater punishment.
