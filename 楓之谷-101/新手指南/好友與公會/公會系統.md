*   **Leave Guild**: Click the button and then click Confirm to immediately leave the guild.
*   **Your Activity**: You can check your position and activities in the guild.
## 4. 公會活動分數

As guild members' activity scores accumulate, Honor EXP, the guild's experience points, also accumulates.

When your accumulated activity scores reach 10, you will get an additional 3 Guild Points (GP). You can accumulate guild activity scores regardless of guild level. You cannot earn more than 5,000 activity score points per person per day.

*   However, the Honor EXP you acquire will be reflected in the weekly Honor EXP ranking, and you can also gain guild points (GP).
## 5. 公會點數 (GP)

Guild Points (GP) are used in a variety of ways, such as advertising for your guild, recruiting guild members, and changing guild marks.
